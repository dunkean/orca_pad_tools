# orca_pad_tools
Tools to fix some Orca pad problems and it's terrible software and  Ableton Live 11 control surface configuration files.

These repo provides:
- a python script to convert a csv editable file into Orca PAD 48 binary config file for easier editing,
- configurations files for Ableton Live control,
- Ableton Live remote control scripts (edited and modified from /link to FCB1010) and using _Frameworks (/link)
